24_SAS_On Difference Between Cloud Computing and Virtualization

Q1
What is virtualization?
A1
IT IS A PART OF CLOUD COMPUTING - HUMAN INTERACTS WITH HYPERVISOR TO CREATE VM / CONFIGURE RESOURCES / PROPERTIES TO LET VM ENVIRONMENT FUNCTION AS NEEDED.
THIS IS A TECHNOLOGY THAT ALLOWS MULTIPLE VIRTUAL INSTANCES OF OPERATING SYSTEMS, APPLICATIONS, OR RESOURCES TO RUN ON A SINGLE PHYSICAL SERVER / HARDWARE PLATFORM.
IT CREATES A VIRTUAL (NOT PHYSICAL) VERSION OF A RESOURCE (SERVER, STORAGE DEVICE, NETWORK) ALLOWING CONSOLIDATION AND EFFICIENT UTILIZATION OF COMPUTING RESOURCES.
IT IS A FOUNDATIONAL TECH THAT UNDERPINS VARIOUS ADVANCED COMPUTING CONCEPTS (CLOUD COMPUTING, CONTAINERIZATION, S.D.N.). IT HAS REVOLUTIONIZED THE WAY IT RESOURCES ARE UTILIZED, LEADING TO INCREASED EFFICIENCY AND COST SAVINGS IN DATA CENTERS AND IT INFRAS.
Q2
What is done in a cloud computing environment?
A2
YOU DONâ€™T NEED THE ADMIN HERE. THE API HANDLES ALL THE AUTOMATION FOR COMMUNICATING WITH THE HYPERVISOR SO THE CUSTOMERS CAN SELF CONSUME CLOUD PRODUCTS VIA API CALLS OR CONTROL PANELS OR OTHER TYPES OF INTERFACES.
Q3
What does API stand for:
A3
APPLICATION PROGRAMMABLE INTERFACE
Q4
What is the function of API?
A4
THE API HANDLES ALL THE AUTOMATION FOR COMMUNICATING WITH THE HYPERVISOR SO THE CUSTOMERS CAN SELF CONSUME CLOUD PRODUCTS VIA API CALLS OR CONTROL PANELS OR OTHER TYPES OF INTERFACES.
Q5
What is the biggest difference between cloud computing and virtualization?
A5
THE CONTROL PLAYING ACTIVITIES (CREATION, MANAGEMENT, MAINTENANCE) HAS BEEN OUTSOURCED TO AN AUTOMATED LAYER CALLED API / OTHER MANAGEMENT SERVERS FOR OUR CLOUD ENVIRONMENT.
Q6
What are the activities controlled through virtualization
A6
AN ADMINISTRATOR. SERVER/DESKTOP/APP/STORAGE/NETWORK/MEMORY/GPU/DATA VIRTUALIZATION, CLOUD COMPUTING, MANAGEMENT AND ORCHESTRATION.
Q7
What benefit is there to using an API over normal virtualization?
A7
AUTOMATION AND ORCHESTRATION, INTEGRATION AND INTEROPERABILITY, CUSTOMIZATION AND EXTENSIBILITY, CLOUD MANAGEMENT AND MULTI-CLOUD ENVIRONMENTS, SCALING AND ELASTICITY, SELF-SERVICE PORTALS, DEVOPS INTEGRATION, SERVICE CATALOGS, THIRD-PARTY INTEGRATION
Q8
What are the benefits of virtualization?
A8
SERVER CONSOLIDATION, ISOLATION, RESOURCE ALLOCATION AND FLEXIBILITY, HARDWARE INDEPENDENCE, DISASTER RECOVERY, RAPID DEPLOYMENT, ETC.
Q9
What are the characteristics of virtualization?
A9
KEY COMPONENTS / CONCEPTS :

HOST MACHINE / SERVER
HYPERVISOR
VIRTUAL MACHINES (VMS)
GUEST OPERATING SYSTEMS
RESOURCE ALLOCATION

CHARACTERISTICS :
ABSTRACTION, ISOLATION, RESOURCE POOLING, ENCAPSULATION, HARDWARE INDEPENDENCE, DYNAMIC RESOURCE ALLOCATION, SNAPSHOT AND CLONING, LIVE MIGRATION, SCALABILITY, COST EFFICIENCY, SUPPORT FOR LEGACY APPS.





Q10
What is a hypervisor?
A10


IN VIRTUALIZATION, A SOFTWARE LAYER CALLED A HYPERVISOR / VIRTUAL MACHINE MONITOR (VMM) IS INSTALLED ON THE PHYSICAL SERVER.

THE HYPERVISOR ABSTRACTS THE UNDERLYING HARDWARE RESOURCES AND MANAGES AND CONTROLS THE CREATION, EXECUTION, TERMINATION OF THE VIRTUAL INSTANCES (VMS). EACH VM OPERATES AS IF IT WERE AN INDEPENDENT, ISOLATED SYSTEM WITH ITS OWN OS AND APPS.
THERE ARE 2 TYPES OF HYPERVISORS : TYPE 1 (BARE-METAL) RUN DIRECTLY ON HARDWARE, TYPE 2 (HOSTED) RUN ON TOP OF AN EXISTING OS.
