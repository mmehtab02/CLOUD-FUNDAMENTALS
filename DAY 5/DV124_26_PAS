26_SAS On Cloud Computing Vs On-Premises

Q1
What is on-premise computing?
A1
TYPE OF COMPUTING WHERE ALL COMPUTING RESOURCES ARE ACCESSED AND MANAGED BY OR FROM THE PREMISES.
Q2
How is cloud computing accessed?
A2
THE POOL OF RESOURCES IS ACCESSED ONLINE
Q3
What is the cost of owning on premise computing?
A3
THE COST IS INCURRED BY THE PREMISE THAT OWNS IT. IT TRANSLATES TO DIMINISHED RETURNS IN THE LONG RUN.
Q4
What is the cost of using cloud computing?
A4
IT HAS A USAGE ON DEMAND SERVICE AND IS PERCEIVED AS A UTILITY - PAY AS YOU GO.
Q5
What are some of the advantages of cloud computing?
A5
UNIVERSAL ACCESS - CLOUD  COMPUTING SERVICES ARE PLATFORM INDEPENDENT. THEY ARE ACCESSIBLE ACROSS MANY DEVICES WITH INTERNET CONNECTION. THIS INCREASES MOBILITY AND PRODUCTIVITY AS IT ALLOWS STAFF TO COLLABORATE ON PROJECTS.

MORE STORAGE CAPACITY - CLOUD COMPUTING ALLOWS UNLIMITED STORAGE AS LONG AS YOU CAN AFFORD IT. YOU DON’T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT RUNNING OUT OF STORAGE.

EASY AND QUICK SETUP - WHEN USING CLOUD ALL YOU NEED IS TO CONNECT TO A NETWORK (OR THE INTERNET), REGISTER WITH A CLOUD PROVIDER AND ADJUST SOME SIMPLE CONFIGURATIONS AND THAT’S IT.

AUTOMATIC UPDATES - WITH CLOUD COMPUTING, ALL THIS IS SOLELY DONE BY THE PROVIDER.

COST EFFECTIVE - YOU ONLY PAY FOR WHAT YOU USE. YOU DON’T INCUR OTHER COSTS SUCH AS MAINTENANCE, SECURITY, AND STORAGE COSTS.
Q6
What are some disadvantages of cloud computing?
A6
SECURITY RISKS - SINCE CLOUD USES INTERNET, INTERNET RELATED RISKS SUCH AS MALWARE, MAN IN THE MIDDLE ATTACKS AND EAVESDROPPING CAN BE EXPERIENCED.

PRIVACY ISSUES - THE AVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION CAN BE BREACHED WHEN USING CLOUD COMPUTING. YOUR DATA CAN BE ACCESSED BY UNAUTHORIZED IDENTITIES OR EVEN MODIFIED.

LOSS OF CONTROL - USING SOME SERVICES OF CLOUD COMPUTING MEANS YOU LOSE CONTROL OVER SOME ENTITIES. THE ENTITIES DICTATE ON HOW THEY’LL BE USED SINCE CLOUD USES THE ON-DEMAND SERVICE MODEL.

INTERNET RELIANCE - IF YOU DON’T HAVE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET YOU ALSO LOSE ACCESS TO THE CLOUD.

CLOUD PROVIDER RELIABILITY - SINCE YOU DON’T HAVE CONTROL OVER THE CLOUD COMPUTING ENTITIES, YOU HAVE TO RELY FULLY ON THE CLOUD PROVIDER. IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO YOUR CLOUD PROVIDER YOU WILL ALSO BE AFFECTED. THIS DEPENDENCY CAN AFFECT PRODUCTIVITY AND ALSO EFFICIENCY.
Q7
Should companies move their data and infrastructure to the cloud or keep it on premise?
A7
WITH THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE INTERNET AND INCREASED NETWORK BANDWIDTH, BUSINESS SHOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF CLOUD COMPUTING.

IN THE LONG RUN, CLOUD COMPUTING IS COST EFFECTIVE AS COMPARED TO ON-PREMISE. IT REDUCES THE OVERALL CAPEX WHILE MAXIMIZING EFFICIENCY AND PRODUCTIVITY.
WITHOUT A DOUBT THE POSITIVES ARE OUTWEIGHING THE NEGATIVES. BUT EACH COMPANY HAS DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS AND DIFFERENT COMFORT ZONES.

IT’S UP TO YOU TO DECIDE IF THIS IS A GOOD OPTION FOR YOUR BUSINESS OR WHETHER HAVING AN INHOUSE IT DEPARTMENT IS A WISER CHOICE.
Q8
How is cloud computing more beneficial than on premises?
A8
COST SAVINGS, SCALABILITY AND FLEXIBILITY, GLOBAL ACCESSIBILITY, REDUCED IT MAINTENANCE, FAST DEPLOYMENT AND TIME-TO-MARKET, HIGH AVAILABILITY AND REDUNDANCY, SECURITY AND COMPLIANCE, AUTOMATIC SOFTWARE UPDATES, ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY, INNOVATION AND ADVANCED SERVICES, BACKUP AND DISASTER RECOVERY
Q9
What is the disadvantage of on premise computing?
A9
HIGH CAPEX / INITIAL COSTS, RESPONSIBILITY FOR ONGOING MAINTENANCE AND MANAGEMENT (HIGHER OPEX), SCALABILITY CHALLENGES, LIMITED GEOGRAPHIC REACH, COMPLEX, COSTLY, LESS SPEED IN DISASTER RECOVERY AND BUSINESS CONTINUITY, SECURITY AND COMPLIANCE RISKS, LACK OF ELASTICITY, TECHNICAL AND SPECIALIZED SKILL REQUIREMENTS (OPEX), LONGER DEPLOYMENT TIME, TECHNOLOGY OBSOLESCENCE (COSTS).
Q10
What is one difference between on premise and cloud computing?
A10
LOCATION OF INFRA AND RESOURCES - ON PREMISE ALL HARDWARE, SERVERS, NETWORKING, SOFTWARE IS LOCATED, MAINTAINED WITHIN ORG’S DATA CENTER / OFFICE PREMISE. THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PURCHASING, MANAGING, MAINTAINING ALL OF THIS TO RUN THEIR IT SERVICES AND APPS. THE TEAM HAS DIRECT CONTROL OVER THE ENTIRE INFRA, PROVIDING GREATER CUSTOMIZATION AND CONTROL OVER SECURITY AND CONFIGURATIONS.

INFRA AND RESOURCES ARE HOSTED AND MANAGED BY THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS IN CLOUD COMPUTING (AWS, AZURE, GCP). USERS ACCESS COMPUTING RESOURCES / SERVICES OVER INTERNET, AND C.P. HANDLES ALL UNDERLYING HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE MANAGEMENT. IT FOLLOWS PAY-AS-YOU-GO MODEL WHERE USERS ONLY PAY FOR RESOURCES THEY CONSUME, PROVIDING COST-EFFECTIVENESS AND SCALABILITY.

In summary, the main difference between on-premises and cloud computing is the physical location and ownership of the infrastructure. On-premises computing relies on in-house data centers, while cloud computing relies on external data centers operated by cloud service providers.
