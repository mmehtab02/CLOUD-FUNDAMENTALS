21_SAS_On Cloud Computing Fundamentals

Q1
What is cloud computing?
A1
CLOUD COMPUTING IS A MODEL FOR ALLOWING CONVENIENT, ON-DEMAND ACCESS FROM ANYWHERE, TO A SHARED POOL OF COMPUTING RESOURCES.
Q2
What does cloud computing resources include?
A2
SERVERS, STORAGE, NETWORKING, APPLICATIONS, SERVICES - CAN BE RAPIDLY AND EASILY PROVISIONED AND RELEASED.
Q3
What are the five essential  characteristics of cloud computing?
A3
ON-DEMAND SELF-SERVICE - THIS ALLOWS USERS TO QUICKLY AND AUTOMATICALLY GET ACCESS TO THE IT RESOURCES THEY WANT WITHOUT REQUIRING ANY ADDITIONAL HUMAN INTERACTION.

BROAD NETWORK ACCESS - ABILITY TO ACCESS A SERVICE FROM ANY STANDARD DEVICE THAT IS CONNECTED TO THE NETWORK - PCS, LAPTOPS, PHONES, TABLETS.

RESOURCE POOLING - COMPUTE, NETWORKING, AND STORAGE ARE POOLED AND SHARED ACROSS MULTIPLE CUSTOMERS.

RAPID ELASTICITY - THIS ALLOWS YOU TO SCALE OR SHRINK THE CAPABILITIES OF YOUR CLOUD TO MATCH THE LEVEL OF USER DEMAND.

METERING - THIS TRACKS AND CONTROLS THE LEVEL OF RESOURCE USAGE OR THE COST OF THAT RESOURCE USAGE.


Q4
What are the three options for cloud deployments?
A4
PUBLIC, PRIVATE, HYBRID CLOUD MODELS

ENTERPRISES ARE ABLE TO DEVELOP A FLEXIBLE AND AGILE INFRASTRUCTURE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE BUSINESS, WHILE REDUCING COSTS.
Q5
What is a private cloud?
A5
PROVISIONED FOR THE EXCLUSIVE USE FOR A SINGLE ORGANIZATION.
THE INFRA IS USUALLY OWNED MANAGED OPERATED BY THE ORG WITHIN ITS OWN FIREWALL
Q6
What is a Public Cloud?
A6
OPEN FOR USE BY THE GENERAL PUBLIC. THE C.S.P. OWNS, MANAGES, OPERATES THIS TYPE OF CLOUD AND RUNS ON THEIR PREMISES.
Q7
What is a Hybrid cloud?
A7
ALLOWS A USER TO ACCESS BOTH PRIVATE AND PUBLIC CLOUD RESOURCES FROM A SINGLE MANAGEMENT ENVIRONMENT.
Q8
What are the 3 types of IT services available today?
A8
SAAS - ACCESS THE APP, LITTLE OR NO CONTROL DELIVERY (WITHOUT HAVING TO MANAGE OR CONTROL THE UNDERLYING CLOUD INFRA) - GMAIL, SALESFORCE

PAAS - ACCESS TO A SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT ALLOWING THEM TO CREATE THEIR OWN CLOUD APPS USING PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES, LIBRARIES, SERVICES, TOOLS. - USER HAS CONTROL OVER THE APP - WITHOUT HAVING TO MANAGE OR CONTROL THE UNDERLYING CLOUD INFRA - SOME CONTROL OVER CONFIG SETTINGS FOR THE APP HOSTING ENVIRONMENT, NO INFRA CONTROL. CLOUD FOUNDRY

IAAS - ALLOWS USER TO QUICKLY AND EASILY PROVISION FULL COMPUTING RESOURCES, INCLUDING PROCESSING, STORAGE, NETWORK, WITHOUT HAVING TO MANAGE OR CONTROL UNDERLYING INFRA. SUSE OPENSTACK CLOUD.
Q9
What are the services responsible for?
A9


Q10
How is IAAS helpful?
A10
MOST DATA CENTERS TODAY ARE HIGHLY VIRTUALIZED - IT CAN TAKE DAYS OR WEEKS TO PROVISION A VIRTUAL MACHINE, AND LONG TO GET THE AUTHORIZATION.

PUBLIC IAAS CLOUD OFFERINGS LIKE AMAZON FOR EXAMPLE GREW RAPIDLY BECAUSE OF THIS NEED FOR ON DEMAND COMPUTING RESOURCES THAT INTERNAL IT DEPARTMENTS WEREN’T CAPABLE OF PROVIDING QUICKLY ENOUGH.

THE C.S.P. OFFERED A SOLUTION WHERE ANY INDIVIDUAL OR COMPANY CAN PROVISION A SERVER THEMSELVES WHEN THEY NEEDED IT, RUN IT FOR AS LONG AS THEY NEEDED IT, THEN SHUT IT DOWN.

THEY PLAY THE CSP AN ONGOING OPEX FOR ONLY THE COMPUTING RESOURCES THEY NEED. USING A PUBLIC CLOUD IS OFTEN SEEN AS A GOOD WAY TO GET ACCESS TO THESE RESOURCES FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.

A PRIVATE CLOUD IAAS EXTENDS THE BENEFITS OF A PIAAS TO YOUR COMPANY’S OWN DATA CENTER. IT CAN HELP YOU RESPOND FASTER TO CHANGING BUSINESS AND CUSTOMER DEMANDS AND LOWER COSTS BY INTRODUCING MORE AUTOMATION AND BY IMPROVING THE EFFICIENCY OF YOUR IT ENVIRONMENT.

BECAUSE IT IS INSIDE YOUR ORGS FIREWALL, IT GIVES YOU BETTER CONTROL OF SECURITY AND DATA, AS WELL AS HELPS ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATIONS.
