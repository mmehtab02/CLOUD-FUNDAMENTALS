4_SAS_On key Concepts and Terminology


Q1
What are key concepts in cloud services?
ANS
HIGH AVAILABILITY

SCALABILITY

ELASTICITY

AGILITY

FAULT TOLERANCE

DISASTER RECOVERY

GLOBAL REACH

CUSTOMER LATENCY CAPABILITIES

PREDICTIVE COST CONSIDERATIONS

TECHNICAL SKILL REQUIREMENTS

INCREASED PRODUCTIVITY
Q2
What is high availability in cloud services?
ANS
ABILITY TO KEEP SERVICES UP AND RUNNING FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME. BUSINESS MUST MAKE SURE THERE IS VERY LITTLE DOWNTIME DEPENDING ON THE SERVICE (WEB APPS, DATABASES). CANNOT TO AFFORD TO HAVE DOWNTIME SINCE IT WILL HAVE NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON BUSINESS.
Q3
What is scalability in cloud services?
ANS
ABILITY TO INCREASE / DECREASE RESOURCES FOR ANY GIVEN WORKLOAD.

(ECOM WEB APP TRAFFIC)

SCALING OUT - ADD ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO SERVICE WORKLOAD.

SCALING UP -  ADD ADDITIONAL CAPABILITIES TO MANAGE / INCREASE DEMAND TO EXISTING RESOURCE.

SCALABILITY DOES NOT HAVE TO BE DONE AUTOMATICALLY.
Q4
What is elasticity in cloud services?
ANS
ABILITY TO AUTOMATICALLY / DYNAMICALLY INCREASE / DECREASE RESOURCES AS NEEDED.

ELASTIC RESOURCES MATCH CURRENT NEEDS AND RESOURCES ARE ADDED / REMOVED AUTOMATICALLY TO MEET FUTURE DEMANDS WHEN NEEDED.

MOST ADVANTAGEOUS PART OF CLOUD COMPUTING.
Q5
What is the difference between elasticity and scalability?
ANS
ELASTICITY IS DONE AUTOMATICALLY.
Q6
What is agility in cloud services?
ANS
ABILITY TO REACT QUICKLY - CLOUD SERVICES CAN ALLOCATE AND REALLOCATE RESOURCES QUICKLY - PROVIDED ON DEMAND THROUGH SELF SERVICE PORTAL - VAST AMOUNT OF COMPUTIVE RESOURCES CAN BE PROVISIONED IN MINUTES, NO MANUAL INTERVENTION IN PROVISIONING / DEPROVISIONING SERVICES.
Q7
What is fault tolerance in cloud services?
ANS
ABILITY TO REMAIN UP AND RUNNING EVEN IN EVENT OF COMPONENT OR SERVICE FAILURE - REDUNDANCY IS BUILT INTO CLOUD ARCHITECTURE, IF ONE COMPONENT FAILS, A BACKUP COMPONENT TAKES ITS PLACE.

TYPE OF SERVICE IS SAID TO BE “TOLERANT OF FAULTS”.
Q8
What is disaster recovery in cloud services?
ANS
ABILITY TO RECOVER FROM AN EVENT THAT HAS TAKEN DOWN A CLOUD SERVICE.
C.S.D.R. CAN HAPPEN VERY QUICKLY WITH AUTOMATION AND SERVICES CAN BE READILY AVAILABLE TO YOU.
Q9
What are customer latency capabilities in cloud services?
ANS
IF CUSTOMERS EXPERIENCE SLOWNESS WITH A PARTICULAR CLOUD SERVICE THEY ARE SAID TO BE EXPERIENCING SOME “LATENCY”.

FIBER OPTICS ARE FAST BUT SERVICES STILL MAY TAKE TIME TO REACT TO CUSTOMER ACTIONS ESPECIALLY IF SERVICES ARE NOT LOCAL TO A CUSTOMER.

CLOUD SERVICES HAVE THE ABILITY TO DEPLOY RESOURCES IN DATA CENTERS AROUND THE GLOBE THEREFORE ADDRESSING CUSTOMERS’ LATENCY ISSUES.
Q10
What are predictive cost considerations in cloud services?
ANS
ABILITY OF USERS TO PREDICT WHAT COST THEY WILL INCUR FOR A PARTICULAR CLOUD SERVICE.

COSTS FOR INDIVIDUAL SERVICES ARE MADE AVAILABLE AND TOOLS ARE PROVIDED THAT ALLOW YOU TO PREDICT WHAT COSTS A SERVICE WILL INCUR.

YOU CAN ALSO PERFORM ANALYSES BASED ON FUTURE GROWTH.
