1
Only New startup companies benefit from cloud companies and not the existing large companies? True/False
ANS
FALSE
2
What are some benefits of using cloud computing?
ANS
COST EFFECTIVE SOLUTION - PAY AS YOU USE SERVICES / CONSUMPTION BASED PRICING MODEL - NO UPFRONT COSTS - ANALOGY OF RENTING HARDWARE - NO NEED TO PURCHASE AND MANAGE INFRASTRUCTURE - COST PREDICTION (PRICES FOR INDIVIDUAL SERVICES AND RESOURCES ARE PROVIDED) OF BILLING PERIODS - EXPECTED USAGE, NEXT MONTH BILL - ANALYSIS BASED ON FUTURE GROWTH USING HISTORICAL USAGE DATA TRACKED BY CLOUD PROVIDER.

SCALABILITY - INCREASE / DECREASE RESOURCES / SERVICES BASED ON DEMAND. WITH ON PREMISES, THIS IS A DIFFICULT FEATURE.

ELASTICITY - ON YOUR PREMISE, YOU NEED TO PROCURE A LOT OF INFRA - IN CLOUD THERE IS NO NEED BECAUSE SCALABILITY IS DONE ON DEMAND.

ECOMMERCE APP - SALE GOING ON - SPIKE IN TRAFFIC - CLOUD IS ELASTIC IN NATURE - C.P. CAN ALLOCATE MORE RESOURCES FOR INCREASED TRAFFIC, AND DECREASE WHEN TRAFFIC FADES.

CURRENT/UPDATED

RELIABLE

CLOUD IS GLOBAL

CLOUD IS SECURE
3
What are key attractive features of cloud computing?
ANS
SCALABILITY, ELASTICITY
4
What are two types of scaling?
ANS
VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL SCALING
5
What is Horizontal scaling?
ANS
PROCESS OF ADDING MORE SERVERS THAT FUNCTION TOGETHER AS ONE SINGLE BUSINESS UNIT - ECOM EX. - WEB SERVERS HANDLE LOAD OF PRODUCTION, CURRENT TRAFFIC, MORE TRAFFIC MORE SERVERS PROVISIONED, AUTOMATICALLY CONNECTED TO LOAD BALANCER.

SCALING OUT.
6
What is Vertical scaling?
ANS
ADDING RESOURCES TO EXISTING SET OF SERVERS - 4GB MEMORY, 4-6GB SPIKE ON EXISTING SERVER.

SCALING UP.
7
Cloud Computing is Current/Updated? True/False.
ANS
TRUE - FOCUS ON THINGS THAT MATTER (BUSINESS, BUILDING AND DEPLOYING APPS) - YOU ARE PROVIDED BEST TOOLS.
BURDEN OF PATCH, MAINTENANCE OF SOFTWARE, HARDWARE, UPGRADES, IT MANAGEMENT TASKS IS DONE FOR YOU.
CLOUD HARDWARE IS MAINTAINED AND UPGRADED BY THE C.P.
8
How reliable is the cloud?
ANS
C.P. TAKES CARE OF DATA - AVAILABILITY, DATA BACKUPS, DISASTER RECOVERY, DATA REPLICATION SERVICES

YOUR DATA IS ALWAYS SAFE.

REDUNDANCY BUILT INTO CLOUD SERVICE ARCHITECTURE (FAULT TOLERANCE) - IF ONE COMPONENT FAILS, BACKUP COMPONENT TAKES PLACE. - THIS ENSURES THE CUSTOMER IS NOT IMPACTED IN CASE OF DISASTER.

DISASTER RECOVERY, FAULT TOLERANCE, BACK UPS, AVAILABILITY OF CRITICAL FEATURES.
9
How is the cloud available globally?
ANS
REDUNDANT DATA CENTERS SPREAD ACROSS DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORLD. CLOUD HAS GEOGRAPHICAL FOOTPRINT FOR CUSTOMERS TO MAKE SURE CUSTOMERS FEEL APPS ARE RUNNING LOCALLY, AND THEY GET BEST RESPONSE TIME NO MATTER WHERE THEY ARE IN THE WORLD. REPLICATE SERVICES IN MULTIPLE REGIONS FOR REDUNDANCY, LOCALITY, LOW LATENCY. MEET DATA RESIDENCY AND COMPLIANCE LAWS FOR REGIONS.
10
Cloud computing is more secure compared to physical devices? True/False.
ANS
TRUE - PHYSICAL / TECHNICAL / DIGITAL OVERHEAD ON CUSTOMERS.
WITH CLOUD, C.P. TAKES CARE OF INFRA WITH WALLS, GUARDS, GATES, CAMERAS, STRICT PROCEDURES, DIGITAL SECURITY.
DATA IS ON SHARED POOL. SECURITY TOOLS PROVIDED BY C.P.
