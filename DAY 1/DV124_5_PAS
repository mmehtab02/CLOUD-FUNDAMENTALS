5_SAS_On Economies of Scale

1
What is the concept of economies of scale?
ANS
ABILITY TO DO THINGS MORE CHEAPLY AND EFFICIENTLY WHEN OPERATING AT A LARGER SCALE IN COMPARISON TO OPERATING AT A SMALLER SCALE.

COST ADVANTAGES GAINED BY BUSINESS / ORG AS ITS SCALE OF OPERATION INCREASES.

PRODUCING MORE OF A GOOD OR PROVIDING MORE SERVICES (QUANTITY OF OUTPUT / LEVEL OF PRODUCTION INCREASE) CAN RESULT IN LOWER AVERAGE COSTS (AVERAGE COST PER UNIT OF OUTPUT DECREASE).

THIS CONCEPT IS RELEVANT IN INDUSTRIES WITH HIGH FIXED COSTS (CLOUD COMPUTING, MANUFACTURING, TRANSPORTATION, TELECOM).

FACTORS THAT RESULT IN ECONOMIES OF SCALE :
SPREAD OF FIXED COSTS (LARGE DATA CENTER FOR MULTIPLE CUSTOMERS MORE COST EFFECTIVE VS. SMALL DATA CENTER FOR EACH CUSTOMER) - FIXED COSTS (INFRA, TECH INVESTMENTS) SPREAD OVER LARGER OUTPUT QUANTITY REDUCING COST PER UNIT.
SPECIALIZATION AND DIVISION OF LABOR - PRODUCTION INCREASE, SPECIALIZED ROLES AND DIVISION OF LABOR MORE FEASIBLE - WORKERS FOCUS ON SPECIFIC TASKS BECOMING MORE EFFICIENT AND PRODUCTIVE, LEADING TO COST SAVINGS.
BULK PURCHASING - LARGER PRODUCTION QUANTITIES ENABLE BETTER NEGOTIATION DEALS / DISCOUNTS FOR COMPONENTS, EQUIPMENT, RAW MATERIAL. LOWER UNIT COSTS = REDUCTION IN PRODUCTION EXPENSES.
TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION - COMPANIES INVEST IN ADVANCED TECH AND INNOVATION AS IT SCALES UP = EFFICIENCY, AUTOMATION, STREAMLINES PROCESSES = COST SAVINGS.
LEARNING CURVE - INCREASED PRODUCTION VOLUMES PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR LEARNING AND EXPERIENCE. WORKERS MORE SKILLED, PROCESSES OPTIMIZED, ERRORS MINIMIZED = INCREASED PRODUCTIVITY & REDUCED COSTS.
2
In cloud services which companies are able to leverage from economies of scale.
ANS
AMAZON, MICROSOFT, GOOGLE, ALIBABA, IBM - THEY CAN LEVERAGE THESE BENEFITS OF ECONOMIES OF SCALE AND PASS THOSE BENEFITS TO CUSTOMERS.

DUE TO THEIR EXTENSIVE LARGE SCALE INFRA AND LARGE CUSTOMER BASE THESE COMPANIES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO LEVERAGE ECONOMIES OF SCALE.

SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN DATA CENTERS, EXTENSIVE NETWORKING, OTHER SUPPORTING TECHNOLOGIES ALLOW THEM TO BENEFIT FROM COST ADVANTAGES AND PROVIDE COMPETITIVE PRICING TO CUSTOMERS.

THEY CAN ACHIEVE COST EFFICIENCIES, NEGOTIATE BETTER DEALS WITH SUPPLIERS, AND PROVIDE COMPETITIVE PRICING.
3
In what way have the large cloud service providers been able to provide cloud services at lower prices to their users?
ANS
ACQUIRING HARDWARE AT LOWER COSTS VS. SINGLE USERS OR SMALL BUSINESS PURCHASING IT.

(SPREAD OF FIXED COSTS) (BULK PURCHASING)
{ECONOMIES OF SCALE}

OTHER WAYS : RESOURCE OPTIMIZATION, CONTINUOUS INNOVATION (R&D), COMPETITION v)
4
Cloud service providers competing against each other is also the reason for lower cloud service prices for users? True/False
ANS
TRUE - PRICE REDUCTIONS, PROMOTIONS, DISCOUNTS, SERVICE QUALITY, FEATURES, PERFORMANCE, SECURITY, CUSTOMER SUPPORT - THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT PUSHES INNOVATION AND IMPROVEMENT WHILE KEEPING PRICES AFFORDABLE FOR USERS TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN CUSTOMERS, AIMING TO GAIN A LARGER MARKET SHARE.

OTHER FACTORS LIKE ECONOMIES OF SCALE, ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY, EFFICIENCY GAINS IN DATA CENTER OPERATIONS ALSO PLAY A ROLE IN COST REDUCTION OF CLOUD SERVICES OVER TIME.
5
What is Investment in R&D in economies of  scope and scale?
ANS
CORE TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION -
6
What is Faster R&D innovation in economies of  scope and scale?
ANS
LARGER CONTRIBUTION PER SEAT -
7
What is the Increased success rate in economies of  scope and scale?
ANS
FASTER GROWTH IN INSTALLED BASE OF CUSTOMER AND SEATS -
8
What is Infrastructure costs decrease in economies of  scope and scale?
ANS
SUPPLY SIDE ECONOMIES : COST OF POWER, LABOR, SECURITY AND RELIABILITY, BUYING POWER -
9
What is Utilization variability decreases in economies of  scope and scale?
ANS
DEMAND SIDE ECONOMIES : USAGE VARIABILITY DIVERSIFIED AWAY LEADING TO BETTER UTILIZATION (TIME-OF-DAY, SEASONAL, INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC) -
10
What is Faster revenue growth in economies of  scope and scale?
ANS
VENDOR RESPONSIVENESS, PRODUCT AND PROCESS INNOVATION, SECURITY AND RELIABILITY, NEW DIFFERENTIATED FEATURES -
