2_SAS_On What is Cloud Computing -2.


1.
What are some examples of services provided by cloud service providers?
Ans
IaaS (storage, cpu, v.m., networking, etc.)
PaaS (platform for development, testing, deploying apps without infrastructure managements)
SaaS (delivery of software apps on subscription basis - email services, CRM, etc.)

Responsible for physical infrastructure and hardware required to execute your work, and keeping things up to date.
2.
What is the benefit of using cloud services from cloud service providers?
Ans
THE GOAL IS TO MAKE RUNNING A BUSINESS EFFICIENT AND EASIER. TO MEET THE NEEDS OF SMALL AND LARGE SCALE BUSINESS, CLOUD COMPUTING PROVIDES A WIDE RANGE OF SERVICES.


3.
What are some popular examples of cloud service providers?
Ans
MICROSOFT, AMAZON, GOOGLE
4.
What are some cloud computing services?
Ans
COMPUTE POWER (LINUX, WEB APPS), STORAGE (FILES, DATABASES), NETWORKING, ANALYTICS
5.
What is compute power?
Ans
WHEN YOU DO ACTIVITIES ON THE INTERNET, YOU ARE INTERACTING WITH SERVERS LOCATED ELSEWHERE THROUGH YOUR BROWSER (CLOUD BASED).

WE DEPEND ON VARIOUS SERVICES PROVIDED BY DIFFERENT CLOUD PROVIDERS THAT MAKE UP THE INTERNET.

CLOUD COMPUTING SOLUTIONS CAN BE CONFIGURED TO PRIORITIZE CERTAIN TASKS FOR THE SERVICE - YOU CAN CREATE VIRTUAL MACHINES THAT WILL USE THE SAME HARDWARE.

EACH VIRTUAL MACHINE WILL HAVE ITS OWN OS, HARDWARE (VIRTUALLY), AND YOU CAN PUT DIFFERENT SOFTWARE ON THEM TO RUN TASKS.

WITH CLOUD YOU CAN HAVE A VM READY TO RUN VERY QUICKLY AND WILL BE COST EFFICIENT AND OPTIMAL IN PERFORMANCE.

THERE ARE MORE COMPUTING CHOICES BESIDES V.M.S.
6.
Virtual Machines, Containers and Serverless computing are different? True/False
Ans
TRUE
7.
What is container computing?
Ans
PROVISION OF CONSISTENT ISOLATED EXECUTION ENVIRONMENTS FOR APPLICATIONS. THEY DO NOT REQUIRE A GUEST OS LIKE V.M. ALL OF THE CONTAINERâ€™S APPLICATIONS AND DEPENDENCIES ARE PACKED INTO A CONTAINER. A STANDARD RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT IS USED TO EXECUTE THE APPLICATION.

THIS ELIMINATES THE NEED FOR THE OVERHEAD OF THE O.S. TO BOOT AND INITIALIZE THE SYSTEM AND SPEEDS UP THE PROCESS FOR STARTING THE CONTAINERS. ONLY THE APPLICATION IS NEEDED TO LAUNCH.
8.
What is a docker?
Ans
OPEN SOURCE PROJECT THAT IS A LEADER PLATFORM FOR MANAGING CONTAINERS.

DOCKER CONTAINERS PROVIDE AN EFFICIENT LIGHTWEIGHT APPROACH TO APPLICATION DEPLOYMENT BECAUSE THEY ALLOW DIFFERENT COMPONENTS OF THE APPLICATION TO BE DEPLOYED INDEPENDENTLY IN DIFFERENT CONTAINERS.
9.
What is serverless computing?
Ans
RUN APPLICATION CODE WITHOUT CREATING, MAINTAINING, CONFIGURING, A SERVER.
10.
What is the core idea of serverless computing?
Ans
YOUR APPLICATION IS BROKEN INTO SEPARATE FUNCTIONS THAT RUN WHEN TRIGGERED BY SOME ACTION - IDEAL FOR AUTOMATED TASKS.

FOR EX: SERVERLESS PROCESS FOR EMAIL CONFIRMATION AFTER ONLINE PURCHASE.

SERVERLESS YOU ONLY PAY FOR PROCESSING TIME FOR EACH FUNCTION, WITH V.M.S AND CONTAINERS YOU ARE CHARGED WHEN THEY ARE RUNNING.

APP LOGIC IS SEPARATED INTO INDEPENDENT UNITS - TEST, UPDATE, LAUNCH IN MICROSECONDS (FASTEST OPTION).
