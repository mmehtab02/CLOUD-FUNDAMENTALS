1_SAS_On What is Cloud Computing -1.


Q1
What type of hardware do we need to build an application?
Ans
SERVERS, OPERATING SYSTEMS, FIREWALLS, SWITCHES, ROUTERS, LOAD BALANCERS, DATABASES, ETC.
Q2
What is the difference between capital expenditure and operational expenditure?
Ans
CAPITAL EXPENDITURE IS THE AMOUNT OF MONEY YOU NEED TO INVEST INITIALLY TO PROCURE THE HARDWARE.

OPERATIONAL EXPENDITURE - WHAT YOU NEED TO MAINTAIN THE HARDWARE.

(HEATING, VENTILATION, ELECTRICITY, HUMAN MAN POWER, MAINTENANCE, ETC.)
Q3
What type of resource do small businesses and companies have now that wasn’t available traditionally, where companies don’t have to invest in hardware?
Ans
CLOUD COMPUTING - STARTUPS PLACE RESOURCES

(DATA, A.I., SERVERS, DATABASES, NETWORKS, SOFTWARES, ETC.)

INTO THE CLOUD WHICH IS A MASSIVE DATA CENTER MAINTAINED BY THE CLOUD PROVIDER.
A4
What are some examples of cloud providers?
Ans
MICROSOFT, AMAZON, GOOGLE CLOUD
Q5
What is the benefit of using the cloud?
Ans
CLOUD PROVIDERS MAKE SURE SERVICES OFFERED HAVE FAST DELIVERY, INNOVATION, FLEXIBLE RESOURCES, AND OPTION FOR SCALING RESOURCES WHEN YOU NEED.
Q6
What is the difference between initial traditional hardware setup and cloud?
Ans
THE CAPEX AND OPEX FALLS DOWN EXPONENTIALLY SINCE IT IS PAYMENT FOR ONLY WHAT YOU USE.

(LOW OPERATING COST, EFFICIENT RUNNING OF INFRASTRUCTURE, SCALING BUSINESS WHEN REQUIRED)
Q7
What is cloud computing?
Ans
NIST - CLOUD COMPUTING IS A MODEL FOR ENABLING UBIQUITOUS, CONVENIENT, ON-DEMAND NETWORK ACCESS TO A SHARED POOL OF CONFIGURABLE COMPUTING RESOURCES THAT CAN BE RAPIDLY PROVISIONED AND RELEASED WITH MINIMAL MANAGEMENT EFFORT OR SERVICE PROVIDER INTERACTION.
Q8
What is the benefit of using cloud computing?
Ans
WHEN YOU NEED COMPUTING RESOURCES (V.M., SERVER, STORAGE, APPLICATIONS, ETC.) YOU ARE ABLE TO CREATE AND CONFIGURE THEM WITHOUT GOING THROUGH ANY QUEUE OR CALL CENTERS TO GO THROUGH A LONG PROCESS AND PROVIDE REQUIREMENTS (8GB, PORT 22 OPEN, ETC.).

INSTEAD YOU CAN DO THIS BY YOURSELF THROUGH A SELF SERVICE PROVISIONING PORTAL (USER ID, PASSWORD) AND CREATE YOUR OWN CLOUD SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE CLOUD PROVIDER.

NO MORE PROCURING DEVICES OR MAINTAINING THEM.

THE CLOUD PROVIDER MAINTAINS EVERYTHING, YOU JUST HAVE TO PAY AS YOU USE IT.
Q9
Where can someone access cloud computing from?
Ans
YOU CAN ACCESS FROM ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD AS LONG AS YOU HAVE INTERNET AND A DEVICE TO ACCESS A BROWSER.
Q10
What was the example given by the federal CIO on cloud computing?
Ans
IT IS AN ANALOGY GIVEN ABOUT WATER.

IN THE PAST EVERYONE HAD ITS OWN WATER WELL. TODAY WE SHARE PUBLIC UTILITIES OF CLEAN WATER BY TURNING IT ON AND OFF. WE DON’T HAVE TO PAY WHEN IT IS NOT IN USE AND THERE ARE PROFESSIONALS MAKING SURE THE SERVICE IS SAFE, SECURE, AND AVAILABLE 24/7.

SIMILAR CONCEPTS CAN BE APPLIED TO CLOUD COMPUTING.
